## Abstract {.unnumbered}

Under some stability condition on a matrix $A$, solving the matrix $Ax = b$ can be done by solving the initial value problem $x' = Ax-b$. In this bachelor thesis, we study some specific IVPs of this form, which arise from the linear system we get as we discretize a particular convection diffusion equation via finite differences.

To solve these IVP, we use a specific two stage explicit Runge-Kutta method, for which we aim to optimize the parameters using reinforcement learning. 

Using policy gradient methods, and in particular the REINFORCE algorithm, we find that reinforcement learning can be applied in that case, with some serious limitations.
