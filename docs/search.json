    "text": "6.1 The test problem, in a RL framework\nAs a reminder, we have a test problem with the following problem parameters:\n\na parameter \\(b \\in [0,1]\\) in the steady-state convection diffusion equation, and\na discretization parameter \\(n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\) defining the number of points in the linear grid used to solve numerically the equation.\n\nWe end up with a linear equation to solve for, which can be solver using the method highlighted before. We wish to find the solver parameters \\(\\Delta t\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) that will minimize the residual of REF as fast as possible. To simplify future computation, we will be interested in minimizing the residual ratio after 10 iteration of the Runge-Kutta solver \\(c_{10}\\). We define this ratio as \\(c_{b,n}(\\Delta t, \\alpha)\\), a function parametrized by \\(b\\) and \\(n\\), with arguments \\(\\Delta t\\) and \\(\\alpha\\). We are faced with the following optimization problem:\nFor any \\(b\\), \\(n\\), find \\[\n(\\Delta t^*, \\alpha^*) =  \\arg \\min_{\\Delta t, \\alpha} c_{b,n}(\\Delta t, \\alpha).\n\\]\nWe are interested in using reinforcement learning to solve this problem. The last section provided an overview of the elements of reinforcement learning, and we can now translate our problem in a RL setting.\n\nA individual state can be defined as a pair \\(s = (b,n)\\).\nAn individual action can be defined as a pair \\(a = (\\Delta t, \\alpha)\\).\nGiven a state \\(s\\), the action chosen depend on the policy \\(\\pi(a = (\\Delta t, \\alpha) |s = (b,n))\\). This policy can be deterministic or stochastic.\nOnce a state-action pair is chosen, the residual ratio is computed. The reward can then be defined as a function of calculated residual ratio, where the lower the ratio(the better the convergence), the better the reward.\n\nThe state transition model is more difficult to find a direct translation for. For the purpose of this thesis, the next state is chosen at random after computing an action and a reward. This is not ideal.\nThere are still several challenges that need to be addressed.\n\n(TODO again, but the point stands)State transition being random defeats the point of RL. The learning rate which is usually set close to 1 for typical RL tasks. Here, it makes no sense to set it this high so it will be kept low.\nState-Action space is continuous. We previously assumed finite spaces.\nIn the definition of a MDP, the reward is a modeled random variable. This is not the case here.\n\nAll of these challenges are addressed in the next sections"

Thankfully, the model can be empirically estimated via Monte Carlo methods.\nIn particular, we often have to compute expectation of random variables. The most basic method is simply to sample the desired random variable and to use the empirical mean as an estimator of the desired expectation.

    "text": "7.3 From discrete to continous.\nIn the last chapter, we made the assumption that the every space, be it state, action, or reward is finite. However, this is in practice not always the case, as some state may be continuously defined for example. Even if those spaces are discrete, the curse of dimensionality may not allow us to efficiently represent every state or action.\nWe take our problem as formulated before. The state is defined as the problem parameters, that is \\(b\\in[0,1]\\) and \\(n = 1 , 2, \\dots\\). Without any adjustment, the state space is of the form \\([0,1] \\times \\mathbb{N}\\), and is not finite.\nSimilarly, the policy is defined by choosing the values \\((\\alpha,\\Delta t) \\in [0,1]\\times \\mathbb{R}^+\\), depending on the state. Once again, the action space is continuous.\nOne approach would be to discretize the entire state \\(\\times\\) action space, and then to apply classical dynamic programming algorithm to get some results. Then, after an optimal policy is found, do some form of interpolation for problem parameters outside of the discretized space.\nAnother approach is to use approximation function. A common approach is to approximate the value function \\(v(s)\\) by some parametrization \\(v(s) \\approx \\hat{v}(s,\\omega)\\) where \\(\\omega \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) are \\(n\\) parameters. Such methods are called value based. The method we use in this thesis, on the other hand, use an approximation of the policy function defined as \\(\\pi(a|s,\\theta)\\), where \\(\\theta\\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) is a parameter vector is dimension \\(n\\). Such method are called policy based. The reason to chose from this class of algorithm is two-fold.\n\nWhen thinking about the test problem, one approach which appears natural is to chose the solver parameters as a linear function of the problem parameters. A policy based approach allow us to do exactly this.\nI know I had other reasons, but it’s easy to implement may not be a good one.\nUsing approximation allow use to extrapolate better.\n\n\nRemark. Approximation is usually done using neural networks, building on the universal approximation theorem(Hornik, Stinchcombe, and White (1989)). In our case, a linear approximation is used.\n\n\n\n\n\nHornik, Kurt, Maxwell Stinchcombe, and Halbert White. 1989. “Multilayer Feedforward Networks Are Universal Approximators.” Neural Networks 2 (5): 359–66. https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/0893-6080(89)90020-8."

The system has for unique solution \\(y^* = A^{-1}b\\). This is a fundamental problem to solve in numerical analysis, and there are numerous numerical methods to solve this, whether they are direct methods or iterative methods. In this thesis, we consider an iterative method. We consider the initial value problem\n\\[\ny'(t) = Ay(t)- b, \\; \\;  y(0) = y_0\n\\]\nwhere \\(y_0\\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) and \\(t\\in \\mathbb{R}\\). Multiplying the equation by \\(e^{-At}\\), where \\(e^{-At}\\) is the usual matrix exponential, and rearranging the terms yields\n\\[\ne^{-At}y'(t) - Ae^{-At}y(t) = e^{-At}b\n\\]\nWe recognise on the left hand side the derivative of the product \\(e^{-At}y(t)\\), and thus, by the fundamental theorem of calculus,\n\\[\n\\left[ e^{-Au}y(u)\\right]_0^t = \\int_0^t -e^{-Au}b \\; du.\n\\]\nMultiplying by \\(A^{-1}A\\) inside the integral in the LHS, we get\n\\[\ne^{-At}y(t) - y_0 = A^{-1}\\left[e^{-Au}\\right]_0^t b = A^{-1}e^{-At}b - A^{-1}b.\n\\]\nMultiplying each side by \\(e^{At}\\) and rearranging the terms we get an expression for \\(y(t)\\),\n\\[\ny(t) = e^{At}(y_0 - A^{-1}b) + A^{-1}b.\n\\]\nNote that each of those step can be taken backward , which means that the solution we have is unique. We have thus proved\n\nTheorem 2.1 Let \\(A\\) be a non singular, square matrix of dimension \\(n\\geq 1\\), \\(b\\in\\mathbb{R}^n\\) a vector, and consider the initial value problem\n\\[\ny'(t) = Ay(t) - b, \\; y(0) = y_0\n\\tag{2.1}\\]\nwhere \\(t \\rightarrow y(t)\\) is a function from \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\). Then the problem has a unique solution in the form of\n\\[\ny(t) = e^{At}(y_0 - y^*) + y^*,\n\\]\nwhere \\(y^* = A^{-1}b\\), and \\(e^{At}\\) is defined using the usual matrix exponential.\n\nLet \\(\\lambda_1 , \\lambda_2 , \\dots , \\lambda_n\\) be the (not necessarly distinct) eigenvalues of \\(A\\), write \\(\\lambda_i = a_i + iy_i\\), where \\(a_i,b_i \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) are respectively the real part and the imaginary parts of the \\(i^{\\text{th}}\\) eigenvalue. The following holds\n\nTheorem 2.2 \\(y(t) \\to y^*\\) as \\(t \\to +\\infty\\) for any initial value \\(y_0\\) if and only if, for all \\(i = 1 , \\dots , n\\), \\(a_i <0\\), that is, all the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) have a strictly negative real part.\n\n\nProof. (In the diagonalisable case)\nWe assume that \\(A\\) is diagonalisable. Write \\(A = P\\Delta P^{-1}\\) where \\(\\Delta\\) is diagonal.\n\\[\n\\Delta = \\begin{pmatrix}   \n\\lambda_1 & & &\\\\\n&\\lambda_2 & &  \\\\\n&& \\ddots & \\\\\n&&& \\lambda_n\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nThen \\(e^{At} = Pe^{\\Delta t} P^{-1}\\), where\n\\[\ne^{\\Delta t} = \\begin{pmatrix}   \ne^{\\lambda_1 t} & & &\\\\\n&e^{\\lambda_2 t} & &  \\\\\n&& \\ddots & \\\\\n&&& e^{\\lambda_n t}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nLet \\(z(t) = P^{-1}(y(t)-y^*)\\), where \\(y(t)\\) is the unique solution to Equation 2.1 for some arbitrary initial value \\(y_0\\).\nSince \\(P\\) is non singular, \\(y(t) \\to y^*\\) if and only if \\(z(t) \\to 0\\). We have\n\\[\nz(t) = P^{-1} e^{At}(y_0-y^*)\n\\]\nWe note that \\(P^{-1} e^{At} = e^{\\Delta t} P^{-1}\\), thus\n\\[\nz(t) = e^{\\Delta t} P^{-1}(y_0-y^*).\n\\]\nLooking at the \\(i^{\\text{th}}\\) element \\(z(t)_i\\), we have\n\\[\n|z(t)_i| = e^{a_it}\\left( P^{-1}(y_0-y^*)\\right)_i\n\\]\nwhere \\(a_i = \\Re[\\lambda_i]\\). Clearly, if \\(a_i < 0\\), \\(z(t)_i \\to 0\\) as \\(t \\to +\\infty\\). If this holds for any \\(i = 1, \\dots , n\\), then \\(z(t) \\to 0\\) as \\(t\\to +\\infty\\). This proves (\\(\\Leftarrow\\)).\nThis is also a necessary condition. Indeed, since \\(y_0\\) is arbitrary, we can chose it so that \\(P^{-1}(y_0-y^*) = (1, \\dots , 1)^T\\). Then \\(z(t) = (e^{\\lambda_1 t}, e^{\\lambda_2 t}, \\dots , e^{\\lambda_n t})^T\\) which converges to \\(0\\) only if all the eigenvalues have a strictly negative real part.\n\n\nRemark. A general proof is available on (Bellman 1953, chap. 1)\n\nWe now go back to the original problem of solving the linear system \\(Ay = b\\). If all the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) have a strictly negative real part, then, any numerical solver for the initial value problem \\(y'(t) = Ay(t) - b\\) with \\(y(0) = y_0\\) where \\(t\\) is some pseudo-time variable also becomes an iterative solver for the linear system \\(Ay = b\\), as \\(y(t) \\to y^*\\).\n\nRemark. If all the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) have a strictly positive real part, then we can simply solve \\(y' = (-A)y - (-b) = -Ay+b\\) instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nBellman, Richard Ernest. 1953.

It may stick and burn at the bottom of the pan if we don’t, but we are lazy and our laziness has to be weighted in.\nOr simply do nothing!\n\nAll of these decisions, which we will call actions from now on, are taken in reaction to the current state of the cooking process, following a certain policy, which is shaped by our previous cooking experience.\nAfter each action, the cooking process get to a new state and we get a reward that depend on how we did.

We want to have a policy that maximize the total rewards we get, which also mean that we have to balance our decision between the immediate reward and the future rewards.

A finite Markov decision process is defined as a discrete time process, where we have\n\na state set \\(\\mathbfcal{S}\\),\nan action set \\(\\mathcal{A}\\), containing all possible actions,\nfor each state and each action, we have a reward set \\(\\mathcal{R}(s,a)\\), which contain the potential rewards received after taking action \\(a\\in\\mathcal{A}\\) from the state \\(s\\in\\mathcal{S}\\).\n\nA Markov decision process has a model, which consist of\n\nthe probability of getting from state \\(s\\) to the state \\(s'\\) by taking action \\(a\\), which we call the state transition probability \\(p(s'|s,a) = P(S_{t+1} = s' | s_t = s, a_t = a)\\).\nthe probability of getting reward \\(r\\) by taking the action \\(a\\) at a state \\(s\\) \\(p(r|s,a) = P(R_{t+1} = r | S_t = s, A_t = a)\\).\n\nFurthermore, a policy function is also given that governs for a given state \\(s\\in\\mathcal{S}\\), the probability of taking action \\(a\\in\\mathcal{A}\\), that probability is \\(\\pi(a|s) = Pr(A_{t+1} = a|S_t = s)\\).\n\n\nRemark. We have implicitly defined the random variables designing the state, action, reward at a time \\(t\\), those are respectively \\(S_t,A_t,R_t\\). A diagram of the process is as follow\n\n(Here is a shiny diagram, I should learn tikz..)\n\nRemark. The state space \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) and the action space \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) can be finite or not. We only consider the case of finite Markov decision process to make matter easier, with generalization only if necessary. This also mean that the model is finite.\nThe model in a MDP can be in practice impossible to define in advance. This is remedied by using so called model free reinforcement learning algorithms.\n\n\nRemark. Markov property applies, in particular lack of memory. (TODO)\n\n\nExample 5.1 (A more mathematical example, adorable)\n(More or less a gridworld example to write about)\n\nAt this point, we may be able to roughly define how to translate the problem (TODO, should formulate it better so I can reference it).\n\nThe state space is defined by the problem parameters \\((b,n)\\). A simplification that could be possible would be to discretize the state space.\nActions would be choosing the solver parameters \\((\\Delta t, \\alpha)\\). This can also be discretized.\nReward can be defined to be proportional to convergence rate after a certain number of iterations, where better convergence rate leads to better rewards.\nThe model can be partially described, in the sense that while we can’t model rewards, we can define the state transition probabilities by simply choosing a new state at random.\n\n\n5.2.1 Bellman equation\nWe first define a trajectory. We note as \\(S_t\\) the state of an agent at instant \\(t\\). Then, according to the policy, this agent takes the action \\(A_t\\). After taking this action, the agent is now at the state \\(S_{t+1}\\), and it gets the rewards \\(R_{t+1}\\). Then the agent takes action \\(A_{t+1}\\), and gets to a new state \\(S_{t+2}\\) with reward \\(R_{t+2}\\). This can continues indefinitely. We define the trajectory of an agent with starting state \\(S_t = s\\) as the states-rewards pairs \\({(S_{t+1},A_{t+1}),(S_{t+2},A_{t+2} ),\\dots}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nA helpful diagram showing trajectory, to be remade with tikz.\n\n\n\n\nIdeally, we would like to chose a policy that aim to maximize rewards along any trajectory, given any starting state. This is the goal of any reinforcement learning algorithm. We now define the discounted return along a trajectory.\n\nDefinition 5.2 Let \\(t = 0, 1, \\dots\\). The discounted return along the trajectory \\({(S_{t+1},A_{t+1}),(S_{t+2},A_{t+2} ),\\dots}\\) is the random variable given by\n\\[\nG_t = R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \\dots\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\gamma \\in (0,1)\\) is called the discount rate.\n\nThe discounted return is thus the sum of rewards along a trajectory. The discount rate is chosen depending on whether we want the agent to favor short term rewards, in which case a discount rate closer to \\(0\\) can be chosen, or long term rewards, with a discount rate closer to \\(1\\).\nSince the discount rate is a random variable, we can look at its expectation, in particular, we are interested in its conditional expectation, given a starting state \\(S_t = s\\). This expectation is called the state value.\n\nDefinition 5.3 (State value) The state value of a state \\(s\\) is the function, defined for any \\(s\\in\\mathcal{S}\\) as\n\\[\nv_\\pi(s) = E[G_t|S_t = s] = E[R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \\dots | S_t]\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\pi\\) is a given policy.\n\n\nRemark. The Markov property of the MDP means that the state value does not depend on time.\n\nThe objective is thus to find a policy \\(\\pi\\) that maximizes the state values. We next derive the Bellman equation.\nIt is first apparent that\n\\[\\begin{align}   \nG_t &= R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \\dots \\nonumber\\\\\n&=R_{t+1} + \\gamma \\left(R_{t+2} + \\gamma R_{t+3}+ \\dots \\right) \\nonumber\\\\\n&=R_{t+1} + \\gamma G_{t+1}\n\\end{align}\\]\nInputting this into the state value yields\n\\[\nv_\\pi(s) = E[G_t|S_t = s]= E[R_{t+1}| S_t = s] + \\gamma E[G_{t+1} | S_t = s]\n\\]\nThe first term is the expectation of immediate reward, following a certain policy \\(\\pi\\), the second is the expectation of future rewards. Let us expand on that formula a bit more. We use the law of total expectation on the first part of the RHS to get\n\\[\nE[R_{t+1}| S_t = s] = E[E[R_{t+1}|S,A]] = \\sum_{a\\in\\mathcal{A}}\\pi(a,s)\\sum_{r\\in\\mathcal{R}}rp(r|s,a)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathcal{R} = \\mathcal{R}(s,a)\\) is the set of possible rewards one can get by taking action \\(a\\) at state \\(s\\).\nWe now develop the second part of the RHS of the equation to get,\n\\[\nE[G_{t+1} | S_t = s] = E[E[G_{t+1} | S_t = s , S_{t+1}]] = \\sum_{s'\\in\\mathcal{S}}E[G_{t+1}|S_t = s, S_{t+1} = s']p(s'|s)\n\\]\nwhere \\(p(s'|s) = \\sum_{a\\in\\mathcal{A}} p(s'|s,a)\\pi(a,s)\\) is the probability of the next state being \\(s'\\) if the current state is \\(s\\). Because of the Markov property of the MDP, we can remove the conditioning \\(S_t = s\\) and thus, \\(E[G_{t+1}|S_t = s, S_{t+1} = s'] = E[G_{t+1}|S_{t+1} = s] = v_\\pi(s')\\). Then \\[\nE[G_{t+1} | S_t = s] = \\sum_{s'\\in\\mathcal{S}}\\sum_{a\\in\\mathcal{A}}v_\\pi(s')\\pi(a|s)p(s'|s,a).\n\\]\nPutting everything together, we get a first form of Bellman equation for (finite) MDP.\n\\[\nv_\\pi(s) = \\sum_{a\\in\\mathcal{A}}\\pi(a,s)\\left[\\sum_{r\\in\\mathcal{R}}rp(r|s,a) + \\gamma\\sum_{s'\\in\\mathcal{S}}v_\\pi(s')p(s'|s,a) \\right]\n\\]\nSome remarks\n\nThe Bellman equation gives a recursive relation for the state values. Solving this equation is called policy evaluation and involves fixed point iterations, which we will not get into details here.\nThis equation is valid for a given policy.\n\nThe expression between the brackets is called the action value \\(q_\\pi(s,a)\\). Bellman’s equation is then simply\n\\[\nv_\\pi(s) = \\sum_{a\\in\\mathcal{A}}\\pi(a,s)q_\\pi(s,a) = E_\\pi[q]\n\\]\n(///TODO)"

    "text": "6.3 From discrete to continuous.\nIn the last chapter, we made the assumption that the every space, be it state, action, or reward is finite. However, this is in practice not always the case, as some state may be continuously defined for example. Even if those spaces are discrete, the curse of dimensionality may not allow us to efficiently represent every state or action.\nWe take our problem as formulated before. The state is defined as the problem parameters, that is \\(b\\in[0,1]\\) and \\(n = 1 , 2, \\dots\\). Without any adjustment, the state space is of the form \\([0,1] \\times \\mathbb{N}\\), and is not finite.\nSimilarly, the policy is defined by choosing the values \\((\\alpha,\\Delta t) \\in [0,1]\\times \\mathbb{R}^+\\), depending on the state. Once again, the action space is continuous.\nOne approach would be to discretize the entire state \\(\\times\\) action space, and then to apply classical dynamic programming algorithm to get some results. Then, after an optimal policy is found, do some form of interpolation for problem parameters outside of the discretized space.\nAnother approach is to use approximation function. A common approach is to approximate the value function \\(v(s)\\) by some parametrization \\(v(s) \\approx \\hat{v}(s,\\omega)\\) where \\(\\omega \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) are \\(n\\) parameters.
