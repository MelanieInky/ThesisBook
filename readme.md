# Bachelor thesis book.

This is a web version of my bachelor thesis. This github repository is mainly here for reproducibility purposes. The book is available at the page



# Usage

To reproduce the experiments in the last sections, simply open the main.py file, change the parameters to the desired parameter and run! This will generate a folder inside the log folder with the date as folder name. Inside is a text file with the hyperparameters used, and a csv file with the evolution of the parameters after each episode, as well as the mean reward each episode.

The book was rendered and published with quarto 1.5.57, using a python 3.11.7 (see requirements.txt), Jupyter 5.7.2.
