In this bachelor thesis, we study the use of this method to solve linear systems which arise from the discretization via finite difference of the one dimensional, steady state convection diffusion equation. These system depends on two problem parameters.\nTo solve these IVP, we use a two stages explicit Runge-Kutta method with two parameters to chose, which we aim to optimize using reinforcement learning. \n\nUsing policy gradient methods, and in particular the REINFORCE algorithm, we find that with some care, reinforcement learning can be used to learn the \nsolver parameters as a function of the two problem parameters. These results are however tempered by some limitations, as the solver can diverge in certain cases, and convergence rate remains low in general. Some different approach to using reinforcement learning are thus suggested.\n\n## Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}\n\n\nI would like to express my deepest thanks to my supervisor Phillip Birken at the university of Lund for the regular discussion sessions, and without which I could not have written this thesis.\n\nI would also like to thanks my partner Sarah (who also fixed an issue I struggled with for weeks in a matter of minutes), for being an amazing partner who is always there to help and encourage me in all aspects of my life. My gratitude also goes to our cat Alyx for her emotional support and the deep talks we have. \n\nFinally, I would like to thanks Paulina Ibek, who worked on a similar thesis at the same time, for the discussions which led to exchanging ideas."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","bibliography":["references.bib"],"csl":"ieee.csl","theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"lualatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","number-sections":true,"include-in-header":{"text":"\\usepackage[ruled,vlined,linesnumbered]{algorithm2e}"},"output-file":"index.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"csl":"ieee.csl","documentclass":"report","geometry":["top=30mm","left=20mm"]},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
